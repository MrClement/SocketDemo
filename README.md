## Socket Demo

Web sockets allow us to set up connections between clients and our server that remember the state of the connection (what has been sent so far) and allow the server to "push" data to the clients.

In this example we use the [socket.io](https://socket.io/) library for Node. The server.js file contains the server in this example and the index.html file contains an example client.
